- Stacks and Queues  
- Trees (binary trees, BST, AVL, heaps)  
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms)  
- Sorting and Searching algorithms  
- Complexity analysis (**Big-O notation**)  

##  Purpose  
The repository serves as:  
- A collection of solved exercises and assignments  
- A personal study reference for exams  
- A foundation for future projects in algorithms and data structures
